If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;
+-------------+-------------------+--------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(danceability) | AVG(valence) |
+-------------+-------------------+--------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.71646           | 0.484443     |
+-------------+-------------------+--------------+

The overlap between the three ratings shows that this listener prefers above average energy and danceability but with a below average musical positivness.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

There are many other factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to identify a users ideal aura, including but not limited to the length of time, or how
many songs were listened to with each specific characteristic descriptor.

This data could then be weighted to more accurately identify the users preference.
