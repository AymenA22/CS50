Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

At lower number of simulations, the number of teams computed is fewer than at higher simulation numbers.
This shows that fewer simulations are not sufficient in predicicting reliable results.
As the number of simulations increases, all teams are included and reliablity increases.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100000 simulations.
