How I chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap?
Javascript was added to interpret the form entry ensuring that a Name is entered (required) and that an email is input in the correct form. The JS returns a message to inform the
user that the form has been submitted.

JS has also been use on all pages to integrate a "scroll to top" button once the user has scrolled away from the top of the page.

Bootstrap was used for site navigation to improve asthetics
